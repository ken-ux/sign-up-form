# sign-up-form

This is a simple website showcasing form basics and validation based on a design mock-up. An error appears if the password input fields do not match. The form does not submit anywhere, it only sends a GET request back to the user as a default.

Note that this is *not* meant to be a responsive website for mobile screens. However, it does work on various desktop resolutions.
